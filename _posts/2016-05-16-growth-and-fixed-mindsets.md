Recently, I finished the book, "_Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance_" by Dr. Angela Duckworth. In my quest to become a better husband and father, I have read multiple books on positive psychology, the importance of mindset and overcoming struggle. 

In my readings, fixed versus growth mindsets has been a common topic. Individuals with fixed mindsets view their own abilities and skills as pre-determined or stagnant. Demonstrating this view one may hear a student say, "I am just not that good at math." Individuals with growth mindsets believe their abilities can be improved. People with growth mindsets are typically more successful and happy in their lives.

For the reasons detailed above, growth mindsets are favored over fixed. Interestingly in "Grit", Dr. Duckworth points out a combination of fixed and growth mindset are even more favorable. Fixed mindsets should be applied to favorable traits of an individuals identity. For example, "I am a hardworking person." When an event occurs which tests a persons resolve, individuals can fall back on the fixed ideal of their identity.

Applying this concept to myself, I recently had a work project require extra hours. Beyond the extra hours, the project had multiple set backs and road blocks. I had become discouraged and frustrated. Reflecting on what I learned, I reminded myself that I am a hardworking and determined person. Although my frustration remained, I was able to push through to ultimately finish the project.

Work projects may not be inspiring but I think the lesson remains. As a parent and a husband, I may feel frustrated and unable to see the next step. Quitting is not an option for me. I would like to continue to improve in these areas of my life. Ideally, I will be able to instill these same values into my children as well. 

I hope this short post will entice you to read "_Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance_". I thoroughly enjoyed the book and hope you do too.
