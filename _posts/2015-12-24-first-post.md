  google pages, etc. None of these mediums seemed to click for me. The tools
  lacked the refinement and ease of use I was looking for.

I have been wanting to build a blog for some time. I have had tumblr sites, google pages, etc. None of these mediums seemed to click for me. The tools lacked the refinement and ease of use I was looking for.
