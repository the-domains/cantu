In the spirit of "One Team" , I thought I would share a book I finished recently, [Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success][0] by Dr. Adam Grant. Dr. Grant describes three basic reciprocity styles; Givers, Takers and Matchers .

Dr. Grant performed extensive research how people's reciprocity styles impacted their long term career success. Interestingly, Givers ranked both the lowest and highest most successful professionals. How one choses to gives has a direct impact on their success.

Since I found the book so though provoking, I thought I would share some of my learnings.

## Why Giving Matters

### Universal Value

According to Dr. Grant, giving or being giving of oneself is universally valued and encouraged throughout the world. Givers are praised in all walks of life and cultures. The most renown givers are celebrated often using their examples to inspire us.

### Its Contagious

When Matchers interact with Givers, the Matchers act more like Givers. Matchers becomes givers and spread the reciprocity style in their community. Additionally, Takers in the same environment attempt to conform. These takers adjust their style to that of a Matcher or even Givers. In other words, Giving begets more giving.

### Givers See Potential

Givers look for opportunities to pass on their knowledge and experience to others. Since givers are in more open frame of mind, they tend to recognize team mates with potential that others may ignore. As a result, givers tend to make great coaches and mentors.

## Successful & Unsuccessful Givers

Now that one can recognize the value in developing a giving reciprocity style in business, there are several tips I would like to share regarding "Successful" and "Unsuccessful" givers.

### Givers & Saints

Choosing a giving reciprocity style in work does not require one to seek Saint hood or lack personal goals. Unsuccessful givers often do not communicate their career ambitions or seek them out.. Conversely, successful givers often have very ambitious career goals and actively pursue them. The most successful givers often look for ways to align their giving with their goals. A great example would be developing expertise in a particular area and then training other team members. Another option would be to document a difficult process. This type of giving has a multiplier effect bringing up the team while simultaneously encouraging recognition for the givers contributions.

### Givers & Door mats

Givers are often viewed as door mats or push overs. Successful givers break away from this stereotype by creating boundaries. Unsuccessful givers leverage only one reciprocity style. Successful givers will engage with team members of a variety of reciprocity styles. Unsuccessful givers interact with Takers as they do anyone else. Takers utilize this opportunity to benefit as much as possible. These unsuccessful givers fail to recognize the relationship as it is; one sided. This relationship often leaves the unsuccessful givers frustrated and distraught. Successful givers recognize Takers and modify their styles to that of a Matcher. This change allows the Successful givers to balance the relationship and allowing for more opportunities to give to others.

### Givers & Burnout

Many unsuccessful givers suffer from burn out. These givers tend to focus all of their efforts in a single area; such as their jobs or places of employment. As a result of this single focus, the unsuccessful givers languish and never find a way to replenish themselves. Successful givers find methods to replenish their energies and destress. Curiously, the most successful methods include a different form of giving. For example, a teacher from "Teach for America" rejuvenated herself every week by volunteering to prepare other new teachers for the program. The change in context reinvigorated her and help her manage burnout.

## Final Thoughts

Even though we value giving in our personal lives; we often change our style when interacting in our professional lives. We view professional engagements as zero sum or winner take all, switching to a Matcher or Taker style. I argue that this change in our nature causes unnecessary stress in our professional lives. Aligning our professional lives with our personal values is achievable and should be sought out regularly.
